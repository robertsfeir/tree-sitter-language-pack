"""Run the registry-mode test apps against in-repo sources instead of public registries.

Registry mode (`alef test-apps run`) resolves every package from its public registry at the
version pinned in `alef.toml` `[crates.e2e.registry.packages.*]`. `alef sync-versions` rewrites
those pins as the first step of release prep, so from the bump until the publish finishes the
pinned version exists on no registry and the whole suite is unrunnable — precisely during the
window where it would catch a bad release.

This provides a "prerelease" mode: a throwaway copy of each test app is staged under
`.prerelease/`, its dependency resolution is redirected at the in-repo package source using that
ecosystem's own override mechanism, and the app's normal test command runs there.

Why in-repo source overrides rather than a local registry: covering these ecosystems with real
registries means standing up a separate daemon per ecosystem (verdaccio, devpi, a Maven repo, a
NuGet server, a Hex mirror, a pub server, ...), several of which have no usable local-server
story at all. Every one of these package managers already ships a first-class "resolve this
dependency from a local path instead" mechanism, which needs no daemon and no network, and is
the mechanism these ecosystems' own maintainers use before a release.

Why a staged copy rather than editing `test_apps/` in place: `test_apps/` is alef-generated and
hash-stamped, so editing it makes `alef verify` fail and makes a subsequent `alef test-apps run`
report a wrong cause. Staging keeps every tracked file untouched and lets lockfiles churn freely.
`.prerelease/<app>` sits at the same depth below the repo root as `test_apps/<app>`, so the
`../../` references the generated apps use for native libraries keep resolving to the repo root.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/prerelease_test_apps.py status
    python3 scripts/prerelease_test_apps.py stage [--lang rust,go]
    python3 scripts/prerelease_test_apps.py verify [--lang rust,go]
    python3 scripts/prerelease_test_apps.py run [--lang rust,go]
